# esp32-aws-upython
I am testing the submission of collected data by ESP32 device running micropython to Amazon Web Service

## What is needed?

1. A micropython full suported device, such as the [ESP32](http://micropython.org/download#esp32)
1. An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
1. It seems [MQTT Protocol](http://mqtt.org/) is much better for IoT devices.
